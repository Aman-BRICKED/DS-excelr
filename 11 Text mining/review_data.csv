0,4.9,bArToS,Just incase it helps someone,5,"January 5, 2019",the United States,So I got these for my build and had a little problem that I haven't seen mentioned.
1,4.9,Jeffrey,They take up less space,5,"January 28, 2021",the United States,"Great RAM, I have a previous version of this ram that is a few cm bigger than this one. This one is SLI=Slim so it is smaller and takes up way less space on the motherboard."
2,4.9,David,Great RAM,5,"May 31, 2020",the United States,"Works great. Got the 2x32gb. Read review thinking it would be Hynix, but I did not get Hynix, I got B-Die? On my 3900x I was able to get 3600mhz at cl16 stable. 64gb at 3600mh sounds pretty good to me! Now I can finally have 3 chrome tabs open."
3,4.9,A. Aurelius,The RGB LEDs may cause unusual errors with iCUE,4,"May 6, 2020",the United States,"The last item I had with several blinking lights on it was my toy robot, ... when I was 4 years old. The RGB LED craze to put flashing lights on every computer component, for the most part seems absolutely asinine. I only purchased this particular model because I needed two 32GB sticks and I have used Corsair Vengeance in the past with good results. I mounted them properly and they work just fine in my Gigabyte Aorus Master Z390 motherboard. By default, the LEDs are set to a slow ""breath"" cycle that changes to another hue every 5 seconds or so. If you want to take full control of the LEDs, you need to use Corsair's monster bloatware program iCUE that will likely #### up more things than it fixes. I went into iBloat and set the LEDs to map to the dimms temperature sensor, so I could tell if they got too warm. Once I made this adjustment, the voltage regulator on my Corsair HX1200i PSU started clicking. Two days later, and I am still troubleshooting the LEDs (the HX1200i has been rock solid for more than 2 years). If the LEDs are set to off, the clicking disappears. I am still fooling with finding a compromise. Stay tuned ...."
4,4.9,Dennis L.,B-Grade product from Amazon?,1,"January 17, 2020",the United States,"I bought two packs of the 2x8 GB Corsair RGB 3200 MHz RAM, one from Amazon and one from BB.  The BB one arrived first and installed without a problem, 16 GB automatically detecting at 3200 MHz using XMP.  The Amazon RAM arrived and after installing for a total of 32 GB, my RAM speed dropped to 2133 MHz.  After some computer use, Windows crashed with the blue screen of death.  The computer would not boot back into windows.  After 2 hours of troubleshooting, I took the Amazon RAM out and restored Windows.  A week later, I bought and installed another pack of RAM from BB.  Worked perfectly fine, automatically detecting at 3200 MHz so now I have 32 GB RAM.  My machine has been running great for a month now.  So you be the judge - coincidence I got a dud from Amazon?  Or does Amazon sell B-grade junk?"
5,4.9,James Gose,Works great with an AMD 3950X and X570 motherboard,5,"July 18, 2020",the United States,"Don't be a fool, reset your BIOS/CMOS/UEFI to defaults before installing this kit! Who has two thumbs and installed the RAM without verifying the timings had been updated? This guy! :)"
6,4.9,Brandon Hirsch,Caused Blue Screen of Death after 1 month,1,"April 13, 2019",the United States,"I ordered this product February 28th. It was great ram, the color fit my build and the lighting effects were awesome. It worked great until today, April 13th. My rig began experiencing MEMORY_MANAGEMENT Blue Screens of Death every 15 minutes, making my computer unusable. I decided to run a Windows Memory Diagnostic and sure enough it discovered issues. ""Hardware Problems were detected. To identify and repair these problems, you will need to contact the manufacturer"". I'm going to try and get this resolved but BSOD's after just over a month? Do better Corsair."
7,4.9,Ray W.,"First set was defective, memtest was erroring...",4,"July 10, 2020",the United States,"I'm using these with the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X on an ASUS ROG STRIX TRX40-XE board at the full XMP speeds, DDR4 3600. Unfortunately the first kit I received was defective and memtest was throwing errors no matter what tweaks were made. Replacement kit is much better, no errors at all - only thing I needed to do was enable the XMP profile and adjust SOC voltage to 1.05v."
8,4.9,RICHARD TURNBULL,FANTASTIC RAM !!!!!!!!!,5,"February 2, 2021",the United States,This ram is great for the IBUYPOWER Mini computer!!!!!!!! Plus many more that can take the 32GB power.the colors are jjust  beautiful and once the software is installed from Corsair youll see what i mean. The a mount is aliitle high but well worth the power. BUY IT!
9,4.9,Spartan40,iCue is bloatware,3,"December 1, 2020",the United States,"iCue is required to customize the RGB, but it can also be used to take over just about everything. It's invasive, can take up over 1gb and secretly installs 5-7 programs that consume resources and can noticeably affect performance on budget rigs. All I wanted was to change the damn RGB lights, I didn't know buying this RAM was gonna subject me to unwanted monitoring and marketing by Corsair. These modules are also high profile which aren't compatible with a number of popular aftermarket CPU coolers which sucked to learn after the fact. I'm returning these sticks right now, RGB is overpriced and not worth the nonsense for just RAM. Also done with Corsair, they're too greedy and have disappointed me for the last time."
10,4.9,Maxximus,"Run great, poor lighting config options",3,"June 14, 2019",the United States,I just want the lighting to turn on during powerup/boot AND turn off during sleep. You have to pick one or the other.
11,4.9,Jeremy W.,iCue software has issues with this RAM,4,"May 21, 2019",the United States,Update: 31Jul2019
12,4.9,Jesse Guthrie,"Beautiful, Well Built Memory accept for a few iCue annoying sound",3,"April 18, 2020",the United States,"There is not much I can say for the memory itself, it's well built and crushes the competition. As for the software, that is a different story. I have an ASUS current motherboard and the Corsair iCue software requires that I have ASUS Aura installed so it can control Aura RGB lighting. Well, if you want everything to work well together then you better have all RGB hardware baring the Corsair name. If you don't then good luck my friend because you are in for annoyances and difficult to find solutions. First noticeable annoyance is a hardware disconnect sound every time the iCue software starts. Secondly you will not want iCue to control Asus Aura devices if you have other name brand products in your system (Like a Coolermaster AIO cooler). Other name brand RGB product's lighting can freeze up especially if they use a 5V addressable headers on the motherboard. In the end I could not get rid of the Disconnect sound but I was able to disconnect iCue software from controlling ASUS Aura devices by deleting the ASUS plugin from the Corsair Plugins folder. If they fix their software and give clear easy instructions that are easily accessible and easy to read then I will gladly give a 5 star rating."
13,4.9,Иiск Р,128gb of ram? In only 4 slots? Heck yeah!,5,"May 10, 2020",the United States,The media could not be loaded.
14,4.9,Dane Brown,Amazing,5,"January 30, 2020",the United States,Perhaps I was lucky but its running stable on AMD x570 at 3600mhz CL16 (hynix chip)
15,4.9,RK,Excellent LEDs,5,"July 24, 2020",the United States,I am writing this review just to let everyone know that they don't turn off when pc sleeps but if you hibernate the PC.. they do turn off and come back on when you wake up the PC..
16,4.9,Q,Upgrade your bios before!,5,"August 5, 2020",the United States,"x570 MSI MEG ACE board. Was running bios 18 and it wouldn’t do 3600mhz. Upgraded bios to 19, worked perfectly. 128gb for a Ryzen 12c workstation is amazing. Rendering in AE reconfigured for it mind blowingly fast. I do use a 3rd party script, BGRENDER MAX, but this ram makes it possible."

18,4.9,ali,Do Not Buy for Asus Prime Z-390 - A,1,"September 24, 2020",the United States,I have really never had any build give me this much pain.
19,4.9,Wild Willy,requires overclocking and non stable boot when running at advertised speeds,2,"May 9, 2021",the United States,"I purchased 4x8Gb 3200 thinking they would run 3200 out of the box, but they do not.  You have to overclock them like using the XMP1 to get 3200 out of them, and then my system will sometimes not boot.  So it is not very stable at the advertised 3200 speed.  CPU-Z says it is DDR-2132 memory even though I bought 3200 memory.  I don't know if this is normal or not, but I do have to run either XMP1 or XMP2 to get the 3200 speed, I can also just over clock the memory to 3200 to get the advertised speed, but you will not get it out of the box, and in my case running it at 3200 makes it unstable on boot.  I have not had any problems after boot running it at 3200, but it will not always boot."

23,4.9,Caroline,"Great Colors, Great Performance",5,"November 9, 2020",the United States,"It's RAM, so I feel like there's only so much you can really say, but I love this particular brand so much.  Aesthetic wise, it's only beat by one other in my opinion, and price wise it just cannot be beat.  The RGB aspect is incredibly easy to program and change, I've set up several different profiles that all sync and change on a single click with other corsair tech that is in this build."
24,4.9,Dennis,just buy it,5,"June 3, 2020",the United States,"Works as advertised, no issues. Not a gamer so I thought the lights would be a distraction. I set them up to give a visual indicator of system temp using Corsiar's software and I really like the result."

26,4.9,RJ Cormack,Great for Creators!,5,"October 18, 2021",the United States,"I purchased 2 sets and created my own matching 32GB set (4x8GB) DDR4 3200MHz Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO Desktop Memory. Check your BIOS! They don't always auto detect the right settings, I had to manually select 3200MHz. Nothing I can't do now, scan a 20Gb image resolution on the flatbed scanner, Photoshop anything, edit videos in Premier Pro, I can create anything and it will save or render it quickly. Stock CPU cooler and 3 120mm case fans, no liquid cooling, NO overnight sessions anymore!"
27,4.9,Chris,3 of 4 had major failures in memtest86,1,"October 22, 2021",the United States,"I like these Dimms, I really do."
28,4.9,James G.,"Expensive, Low Tech, but all Natural.",5,"July 24, 2019",the United States,5 Stars because I know Corsair is good memory.
29,4.9,ONESFUTURE,DO ELECTRIC SHEEP DREAM OF RGB?,4,"July 15, 2019",the United States,"Yes, the technical specs of these are great but you can turn to amazingly informational reviews on certain video sharing sites for that."
30,4.9,Rick,Speed and Memory,5,"July 10, 2020",the United States,"RAM is often overlooked at being the root cause of a slow PC but it's honestly one of the easiest things to upgrade and gain performance from. Great RGB colors, plenty of customizations with iCue software, works fine out of the box, paired with MSI X570 motherboard + Ryzen 5 3600, enabled XMP in the bios & this thing flies @ full speed."
31,4.9,Nyriku,3200 has to run at 2933,4,"April 30, 2021",the United States,"Rgb looks nice can be set with mother board mystic light. The only issue  that I'm having is all 4 dimms will not run ,at 3200 speed. Motherboard msi b 450. Bios is up to date as is windows drivers etc. The xmp will not allow all 4 dimms to be clocked  at 2933, instead  had to be dialed in manually. Worked on this issue  for few  hours to end up with with 2933 memory speed stable. Changing timings voltage had no affect.2 dimms will however run at 3200 under xmp profile. Same voltages and timings. cpu is ryzen 2600 x. All chipset drivers are up to date also. Windows was reinstalled just to be sure  that was not the issue. As if building a new system and the reinstall of all software etc over the next 4 hours.. The end result was the same . There been  no issue since. Install 4/20/21."
32,4.9,Rodrigo,"Micron B-Die, stable at C16",5,"September 20, 2020",the United States,"For anyone curious, mine were Micron B-Die and had no problem running at C16 on an X570 Crosshair VIII Hero, using voltage and everything else at D.O.C.P.. Had 4 sticks plugged in."
33,4.9,Amazon Customer,"Great RAM, but I hate that I am forced to pay for RGB that I don't want.",5,"July 28, 2020",the United States,"The first thing I did once installed, was turn of all the RGB feature.  Other than that, the RAM has been excellent.  Video Editing now has a ton of headroom for rendering in RAM.  My DAW work has also improved, as all of my virtual instruments load into RAM.  128GB felt like overkill for me as I purchased, but between editing 6K footage and composing songs with a lot of instruments, these have turned out to be perfect!"
34,4.9,A Customer,"Fantastic Ram, beautiful RGB. Endless possibilities.",5,"January 13, 2021",the United States,"64GB Ram never looked so good. It looks great, temps are great, and no issues with cable management. Cost is perfect in this range."
35,4.9,luis,Lights stopped working after a year.,1,"June 27, 2021",the United States,"I bought a total of 4, 2 sets of 2. But after a couple of months the RGB lights stopped worked. The weird part is that it didn't happen all at once. It would start off by being one of them not working properly. And then another one would start doing the same. After a while all of them just turned off and didn't turn back on. But it happened slowly, one by one they started to stop lighting up. At first I thought it was my motherboard. So I replaced the ram with another set of Rams with lights and they worked flawlessly. So it wasn't my motherboard. It was these Rams I bought."
36,4.9,Christopher Grow,Its a crap shoot if what you get will run at the rated speed with XMS enabled.,1,"July 19, 2021",the United States,I ordered this product initially in black for a Z590 board and the part worked perfectly.
37,4.9,Juniorverse,Set memory profile to DOCP in AMD BIOS to get full speeds,5,"June 20, 2021",the United States,I am using this in my new Ryzen 7 / ASUS ROG Strix X570-E motherboard.  I had to manually set the BIOS of the motherboard to use the DOCP memory profile to get it to run at full 3600 Mhz speed because it was running at a much slower speed before I did.  It has been flawless since then.  Works great and got it at a great price.
38,4.9,S Beck,"Much Shiny, Much Tall",3,"June 16, 2020",the United States,"If you use an air cooler or have other obstructions around your RAM slots definitely check your clearances first. Otherwise it's very very shiny. I did have to uninstall and reinstall iCue to get this working and (hopefully I get to update this with a software update.., hint hint, poke poke, looking at you Corsair) at this time the RAM does not turn off, dim or have any options whatsoever for what the lighting is doing while the PC is asleep or locked out. I have it running at XMP speeds in my X99 system and it's performing as well as I can expect without having torture tested anything yet. I'm happy with my purchase and I'd like to be able to give this more stars, but if you're going to charge a premium for extras they should be premium features and while it looks beautiful, functionally the lighting and/or software still need some development."
39,4.9,hypersphere,Works @3200 MHz MSI TRX40 Pro Wifi AMD 3970X Running Linux Mint 20.1 Xfce,5,"June 2, 2021",the United States,"I needed to upgrade the RAM in my workstation (MSI TRX40 Pro Wifi motherboard, AMD 3970X CPU, Nvidia 3090 GPU, OS = Linux Mint 20.1 64-bit Xfce). I did not really want RGB LEDs, but during the installation, I found this feature to be helpful because when the machine was booted, I could instantly see which of the DIMMS were illuminated. In fact, I needed to re-seat the RAM a few times to get all of the DIMMs to register. At first, the machine set the frequency to 2133 MHz, but after going into the UEFI BIOS and manually setting the frequency to 3200 MHz, DRAM voltage to 1.35 volts, and timings to 16-18-18-36, I was able to run the RAM at its rated speed. Installation was relatively easy and considering current prices, this RAM was a fairly good value for the money."
40,4.9,Mirela,Good when it works.,4,"August 16, 2020",the United States,"A bit taller than other DDR 4, customized where one of the cpu fans sat in my Be Quiet case to accommodate them."
41,4.9,Austin David Lilly,Wonderful and looks great too!,5,"December 17, 2019",the United States,Appears to function as should and looks great too! Excellent value for money.
42,4.9,Eric S,Great Product!,5,"April 13, 2021",the United States,"I bought these for my new gaming rig because the other ones I ordered were too bulky to fit (interfered with the CPU Liquid Cooling lines).  These popped right in and worked with zero issues.  I've done some stress tests and I wasn't expecting anything to fail, but these DIMMs work really well.  I highly recommend them!"
43,4.9,Christopher,Looks and works great,4,"April 13, 2021",the United States,"Upon receiving the kit, my new system would constantly hard restart itself, only to find one of the sticks was dead, even though it showed a full 32gb in windows. Went through the whole RMA process through Corsair which was very simple and received my new kit, all in all just under two weeks. Corsair handled everything in a timely manner and I am extremely satisfied. The only part less than ideal was the whole kit had to be sent back, despite only one stick having failed. This left me without a working system for two weeks."
44,4.9,Bryan S.,Speed!!,5,"December 12, 2020",the United States,"with this much memory, i finally wont need to upgrade for many years.......came super fast, installed easy, everything worked easy as any stick i have ever used.....simple.  very colorful as well, blends right in with the rest of mobo colors and fans, keyboard, mouse......all in all an excellent long overdue upgrade.......now if only i could locate an nvidia 3080 card......life would be grand.  Dont hesitate if you need memory and can afford this bundle.....you wont be sorry.  Not even once.  Bring on the virtual world!!"
45,4.9,2sofakinggreat,She Wanted Me to Light Up Her Life,5,"September 18, 2021",the United States,I fried my wife's prior motherboard (AsRock Z77 Extreme) and CPU (i7-3770). The MB used DDR3 RAM so I needed to buy new RAM when I bought the MB and CPU. I ended up going with a Ryzen 5 5600G on an ASUS TUF Gaming B550-Plus.

48,4.9,Che Crawford,Roll the dice - you may just end up with the elusive Samsung B-die variant!,5,"November 26, 2019",the United States,"Basic review: Bought these when they were on sale for $69.99 and couldn't be happier. These work spectacularly out of the box, just as one would expect from a Corsair product. The lighting is truly mesmerizing - they look like sticks of candy! Customizability is excellent, so if you're buying these to spruce up your case you won't be disappointed."
49,4.9,Steven,Micron Rev.B,5,"March 15, 2021",the United States,"It's only 3200cl16, not the fastest. I got Micron rev.b die on my kit but ymmv. I ran memtest86 overnight with the whole 32gb kit and it passed 0 errors. If you are upgrading an existing pc that has iCue, since this model is so new, it wont show up unless you update it."
50,4.9,wendu,DOA Dimm,1,"April 13, 2021",the United States,"1st picture shows initial install, I thought it was the RGB being dead, ok I can live with that no problem. 2nd picture goes into Icue sure enough the dim in a2 is not even recognized. 3rd picture windows 10 shows 8gb of ram."
51,4.9,Geffrey beezos,Doesnt work with b450 mobos,1,"December 14, 2021",the United States,After a year of having these sticks they worked wonderfully. Now after a software update from icue they're flashing red and unable to be configured from icue. I've done everything under the sun to fix it from reinstalling icue to reinstalling windows. There is nowhere to download old drivers/firmware on the corsair site short of opening a ticket which you need the product number for....so just to open a ticket you have to remove the ram and copy the number down...hopefully the computer you're using isnt the only way to open a ticket or you're screwed.
52,4.9,Bethany Moore,Works great with my set up,5,"March 20, 2021",the United States,"Going on about 2 months now and they are still working fabulously after a super easy install. When we go to upgrade, instead of buying a completely different set, we plan on buying another set of these to fill our remaining 2 slots of RAM. We play VR with no problem, RPGs with no issues, and often tend to have multiple things going at once which these handle with absolutely no problem. As for the RGB portion, I haven't messed with it yet since my liquid cooler, motherboard, and all 10 of my fans are also RGB but they run on a different program than the RAM does. So that was literally the only thing I thought was odd about them, that and they default to rotate rainbow."
53,4.9,Mike D.,"Tall and Colorful, control via iCue and the RAM works too",4,"February 3, 2021",the United States,"Working from home?  Is your desktop not giving you sufficient motivation?  Not enough warmth in your life?  RGB is the answer!  For almost the same price a normal DDR4 3200 you can get 64GB of memory goodness in two sticks.  The package is detected at 3200Mhz for DOCP as dual-channel running at CL16.  It is not the fastest RAM, but it is one of the taller ones.  It may not clear with Air Coolers, so AIOs or waterloops are the best.  Even with an AIO the USB plugs come very close to the 2nd stick which skips of the empty ones.  Effects can be controlled via Corsair iCUE, despite eating 5% of your CPU, the mesmerizing Rainbow mode provides a fascinating distraction outside of your monitor."
54,4.9,RJC,simply the best blows away G Skill trident,5,"May 14, 2019",the United States,"I decided to go with an all corsair build so I purchased the corair pro 16 gb 3200 MHz kit to replace the G Skill trident z rgb kit I had in my pc, the g skill is quality ram and looked nice but you cant believe the color difference. I am so glad I did, the corsair kits leds are so more vibrant in color amazing also have 10 leds per dim where G skill has 5. I was a little worried because I have an Asus z370 Tuf gaming plus motherboard and when I checked Asus QVL list for that motherboard the Corsair kit wasn't listed. Corsair advertised compatible with intel 100, 200 and 300 series MBs so I took a gamble. Installed pc fired right up. Went into the bios enabled the XMP profile and it is running dual channel at 3200MHZ no problem. Also the Corsair I Que software to control the leds is SO MUCH BETTER than Aura sync, no bugs. And I can sync with my corsair fans. I ordered the light enhancement kit so I have four dims right away. This is simply the best looking rgb ram on the market and corsair quality worth every penny."
55,4.9,Sawyer Halbritter,Unable to hit the 3600mhz mark,4,"March 31, 2021",the United States,"I don't know if this is an issue with the ram, or possibly the CPU and motherboard I'm pairing it with. I'm currently running a Ryzen 5 5600X on an Asrock Phantom gaming 4s mobo and can only clock my ram speeds up to 3200mhz without my computer crashing and removing any ram overclock I had previously applied."
56,4.9,Avalir,Great Ram But the Corsair Software Doesn't Work for these,4,"February 24, 2019",the United States,"So I'm what you might call an RGB Fiend. I love the customization that it adds to any computer case. Now I'm also a fan of Asus Aura, which yes I know, corsair products typically don't work with Aura. Well here is the downside. These particular Ram sticks don't even work with their own manufacturer's software. I downloaded both Corsair link and corsair iCue. They show up in Link but do not show up in iCue which is where you have to go to customize the RGB lights, Kinda looks tacky with those stuck in a fast rainbow while all my other RGB's in the case are on a slower pattern. May end up giving these to my wife for her rig and getting myself something that is controllable by Aura. outside of the software issue though, these RAM sticks awesome, thats the whole reason I went with Corsair."
57,4.9,Amazon Customer,Great Ram for a x390 aorus master,5,"February 26, 2020",the United States,Even though  the RAM was not on the approved list I took a chance based on a user experience.  It works great with no issues.
58,4.9,Austin E.,Beautiful Centerpiece In My Case,5,"December 8, 2019",the United States,"Such a gorgeous addition to my case. These were absolutely worth the extra money for the RGB because they’ve surely become the centerpiece in my case and I couldn’t be happier. With that, Corsair’s software iCUE is easily my favorite RGB software on the market as it lets you go wild with customization. I’ve even noticed the lighting changes during certain games and that was such a cool surprise. Not only that, but I’ve never had any issues with the RAM. Couldn’t ask for more!"
59,4.9,Valentina,Keeps crashing,1,"January 20, 2021",the United States,"Are you serious? This RAM is faulty. It can't even support games like Overwatch and even made my minecraft crash. I thought it was my power supply at first, so i upgraded it. No. It was these rams. I figured it out because my boyfriend took my old ram, and he gave me his ram. He installed  my old rams into his, and his computer starting crashing too."
60,4.9,Camas D.,"Great at stock, issues with XMP and OC",5,"May 2, 2020",the United States,"Edit; 1 bios update later (newest version) and the issue is fixed. Looks like there was a memory issue on the bios I was running, I have these now always on XMP with no issues!!"
61,4.9,Larkin,"Got a total of 4 kits, everyone of them had an issue and would not run at rated speeds",1,"February 1, 2020",the United States,"I ordered 2 kits of 16gb 3200. First set would not run at 3200 at all. Pulled one kit out of PC and tested the kits individually. Would boot at 3200 but would not open any games without them crashing almost immediately. Sent those kits back and had Amazon send me two new ones. These kits lasted together for about 30 minutes with no issues at XMP settings.  Stress tested on prime95 large ffts( or whichever one tested the RAM) and it went for 15 minutes with no errors. Then played Star Wars BF2 for another 15 minutes perfectly fine. Then out of nowhere, blue screen, Computer rebooted and as soon as I signed in, blue screen, rebooted again and as soon as login screen loaded, blue screen again.  Then windows went into recovery mode. So I pulled out the ram and put my older corsair vengeance kit in that runs at 3600MHZ and no issues, I also have another vengeance kit in another computer at 3200 that is the same specs as these white rgb ones and it runs perfect at XMP. Both kits also run perfectly fine together in the same computer at 3200mhz CL16, so I know my motherboard and cpu can handle 4 sticks 32GB total at 3200mhz no problem. So I do not know what corsair is doing to pass these kits off as ""3200mhz"" but clearly they are no longer capable of actually running at those speeds with whatever batch I ended up getting. Shows that corsair doesn't actually test the ram for long enough. Sending these ones back for a refund and ordering a g skill kit to try that out."
62,4.9,NorthStarPC,What You Would Expect From Corsair,5,"July 17, 2020",the United States,"No problems with XMP to the advertised 3200MHz. Performance and overclocking potential also depends on whether you win the silicon lottery or not. Purchased two sets and one was Ver. 4.32 Samsung C-Die and one was Ver 5.32 SK Hynix C-Die. Great RGB as well if that's what you are looking for, not to mention it syncs up perfectly with Corsair iCUE and other Corsair products with lighting. If you are not looking for RGB, I would skip these and just buy the $20 cheaper LPX model without RGB or if you do not need Corsair to sync with other components as $85 is a bit high for 3200MHz."
63,4.9,beng,"Great performance, bad cosmetics (Edited)",5,"February 18, 2019",the United States,"I chose this RAM for my Ryzen 7 build and performance-wise everything worked out nicely. I had to go into the bios and clock it to the advertised 3200mhz, which worked perfectly fine no problems. My only HUGE complaint is that the RAM stopped showing up in iCue after a BIOS update. I know, I know it's not the rams fault but this brings me to my next issue. It DOESN'T sync with Asus Aura as well so I have to look at RAM that are always out of sync with each other. This really irritates me."
64,4.9,Peter T.,Pretty and fast memory kits.,5,"August 18, 2020",the United States,XMP to 3600. Super bright and colorful. It a nice bling for memory.
65,4.9,Giovannie Lizarraga,All I can Say is They are good,5,"October 11, 2020",the United States,"These are out of stock now and I feel evil, bought them for 90 bucks which is awesome, and I see people selling them for 200 now so that’s cool, they work as advertised, just make sure your motherboard can support them, did have some issues with Ique but they work just fine."
66,4.9,Alex,"Running 4x8gb of this RAM, great RAM",5,"March 19, 2021",the United States,"I must say I really like these RAM sticks, I am currently running 32 gigabytes in a 4x8 configuration, that number may be a bit overkill for most users but if you are doing things like running a heavily modded Minecraft Java Edition install or running texturepacks and heavy modpacks in other games then that extra RAM does come in handy (I often use 20 of my 32 gigs when playing my modpacks)."
67,4.9,Saja,Bad silicon.,1,"February 15, 2020",the United States,"This RAM instantly caused a BSoD on my computer. I did all the usual stuff like clearing my CMOS, so I decide to make a Memtest86 live USB. It exited with too many errors (which is over 10,000 errors) after only like 15 mins. I bought these to replace some Corsair 16GB Vengeance non-RGB RAM, which I also ran through Memtest86. The other Corsair RAM passed the full suite of Memtest86 tests without a SINGLE failure. I ordered a replacement from Amazon and it has the exact same problem. Although the replacement sticks didn't cause enough failures to cause Memtest86 to exit, it was not a negligible amount; over 500 errors per pass. RAM that is advertised as ""pro"" should fail Memtest86 ZERO times, as the other Corsair Vengeance (which is $20 less) did."
68,4.9,Justin M.,Beautiful,5,"June 16, 2020",the United States,"Out of the box, the sticks were able to boot up with the specified timings (returned previous RAM from another source because of they did not boot up to the specified timings) so win there. Will try to tighten the timings and see if I can get a little more out of it. It is indeed Samsung B-die so I'm hoping for a little bit of overclocking room, but besides the performance, the RGB looks amazing. The lowest brightness settings still lights up all of the pc case and the preset options on iCue make it really stunning to look at. The colors look really good and give the case a great aesthetic feel."
69,4.9,Justin Burgess,"Fast, reliable, and look decent but..",4,"June 14, 2021",the United States,"I've heard so many people talk about these, they've got fantastic reviews, and Corsair is well known so I decided to get them. They feel high quality, they hit 3600 no problem, and the LEDs look amazing.... in white, but every other color is rather meh. Maybe I had too high of expectations cuz don't get me wrong they look great. Just not as great as I was hoping for. I wish I would have went with TT or Crucial as I think those look better personally. To each their own but I would recommend them if you're doing an all Corsair build cuz iCUE is pretty dope."

71,4.9,Wynn,Perfect fit,5,"April 6, 2021",the United States,If you didn’t know the big difference and the other vengeance ram is the height. Allowing a little more flexibility when choosing a cooler for your cpu. Was easy to install. Looks great! No problems so far!
72,4.9,Michael S,It's pretty,5,"May 8, 2020",the United States,"I mean it is RAM, there is not much to actually review here. It is a market that is kind of niche for people who build PCs. You should already know what you are buying. IF you are kind of new to PC building, just don't buy super cheap knock off ram. Other than that if you match the Mhz and the version of DDR they are mostly the same, yes nuance differences, but RAM is RAM. So the things to look for are just price and looks. These are sexy and I love the software from Corsair. Corsair has tons of other lighting products. It is just a good ecosystem and that is what you are really paying for here in the premium."
73,4.9,Amazon Customer,"Ryzen Compatible, Cool RGB",5,"December 29, 2021",the United States,"Downloading the ICUE software also installed the plugin for armory crate. Although the ICUE software also has some pretty cool effects. I enabled XMP upon installing this ram, all the timings and frequency got set and booted stable into windows. No crashes and I have ran a gamut of benchmarks. I have not experimented with altering the frequency or the timings beyond their XMP values. Its corsair ram, so its going to be a quality product."
74,4.9,Amazon Customer,Corsair never fails to disappoint,5,"December 29, 2018",the United States,Corsair knocked it out of the park with this memory. Not only does it have the great Corsair build quality. It looks absolutely fantastic!

77,4.9,K,Amazon failed in packaging sensitive hardware,3,"August 9, 2020",the United States,"Corsair makes excellent RAM and I am sure this product would have been excellent like most of their products, however, Amazon shipped the RAM to me in a box without any protective packaging. I'm returning the item and may order at a later date as to not recieve the same possibly defective hardware."

Mi PC HP, comprada en Amazon vino con un RAM de 8GB; para ampliarla me recomendaron instalar las dos memorias de 8 GB que vinieron en el paquete, y retirar la que vino en la PC, para que tengan la misma frecuencia y funcionen mejor. Así que ahora tenemos una PC con 16GB de memoria RAM. Muy rápida para los trabajos de edición de videos y fotografías que necesitaba mi hija"
80,4.9,Alex,"Good performance, decent led lighting",5,"January 21, 2021",the United States,"It’s pretty good ram especially if you’ll be lucky enough to get it with Samsung b-die, it’s easier to overclock the ram. I manage to oc it from 3200mhz 16-18-18-36 to 3600mhz 18-19-19-39 running stable. Not the best ram to oc, but good enough for the price."
81,4.9,Christopher Mad,One stick died after a few months.,2,"July 9, 2020",the United States,Check the price every now and then. I waited for them to go back down. My first purchase I got for around 80 bucks. I wanted another pair. But price went up to 99.00. So if you see them st around 80.00. Grab them now. It's a good price. They look beautiful in the case. No problems with the ram at all. Great product. Be sure to download the lighting program. And enjoy them!
82,4.9,JSP,"Fast RAM, albeit with an RGB tax",4,"January 25, 2020",the United States,"This RAM is basically fine - it overclocked to 3200 MHz easily in the UEFI, comes with the usual Corsair RAM lifetime limited warranty, and the RGB works as advertised. But I would probably go with non-RGB RAM (Vengeance LPX, for example) unless this RGB RAM is on sale and non-RGB RAM isn't. I was able to snag this for ~$2 USD more than regular Vengeance LPX; otherwise, I wouldn't have gone the RGB route, as you're paying more for no performance increase whatsoever. With that caveat out of the way, the only other thing to consider is clearance for your CPU cooler (particularly if you're air cooling). It fit fine in my build, so if you like the look, this is a fine choice."
83,4.9,R. Wharton,Great Memory to Fill Out My Gaming PC,5,"February 12, 2021",the United States,"As always, these memory modules are a snap to install. And although, the way they look doesn't add to their actual performance, it certainly adds to the way the PC looks! The RGB option with these modules gives the PC a very cool, distinctive look, and I love being able to program them for different effects! The photo shows them in ""rain"" mode, where the colors cascade downward. The modules seem to be quite stable, and I've not had any issues at all. I don't overclock my PC at all, so I don't expect these modules to ever fail."
84,4.9,Matt,Solid RAM from a good brand,4,"July 23, 2020",the United States,"Overall a good solid stick of RAM, with really just one minor nitpick. If you don't mind paying a bit extra for RGB and have other corsair products you want to sync up with you cant go wrong with these"

86,4.9,tyler,"Products is great, but the price is horrid.",5,"May 17, 2021",the United States,"As if gpu price scalping wasn’t already hard enough on its own... RAM prices have seen to go up buy an absurd amount over the last month or two. I paid $120 for 16gb of 3200mhz ddr4 in 2021.(that didn’t even arrive to MY HOUSE) had to buy more. This is insane, in late 2020 you could easily pick up a 16gb ddr4 kit 2666-3600mhz for around $60-$90. Although $30 dollars is a lot less of an inflation rate than triple the price for most 30 series nvidia cards, it’s still an unfair price gouge that people have to deal with. Nonetheless, the Corsair products never disappoint, great looking, great performance. Corsair vengeance rgb pro is definitely top 3 best looking ram kits out there. Definitely recommended picking one or two of these kits up for any gamer!"
87,4.9,Jake Preble,"Looks great, works great.",5,"November 29, 2020",the United States,It came a whopping 5 days earlier than expected leaving an only 3 day delivery without Amazon prime. I have a prebuilt computer that only came with 8gb of ram so this was the first thing I wanted to upgrade.

91,4.9,Wagon,Quick ram,5,"July 15, 2020",the United States,I am not on the RGB bandwagon. But these after install are a work of art. I had the ram up to 4k mhz with 1.45 volts but have since backed it down to stock 3600 at 1.34 volts. Makes my computer a very enjoyable experience.

97,4.9,G. Q. Tuazon,AMD Ryzen Compatible,5,"March 18, 2019",the United States,"I originally built my PC when the Ryzen 5 gen 1 was released.  I had trouble getting the G Skill RGB 3200 Mhz 16 Gb DDR 4 Ram to stay stable above 2966 Mhz. I am using an Asus X370 Prime motherboard, R5 1600. I finally decided to take the chance and try this Corsair 16gb 3200 Mhz with RGB. Using the latest BIOS, my PC started with no issues. I've configured it and set the speed at 3200 Mhz. It now works well and my system is now reliable. It used to get stuck after 4 to 5 hours of operation."
98,4.9,J. Gay,Do not get if you use aura software,1,"January 11, 2019",the United States,"I had cue1 installed to run the RGB on my strafe keyboard, but this ram would only work with the new icue ... so I installed it. Biggest mistake ever, it caused aura to crash and not detect anything and completely removed all my cue1 profiles, and after that it wouldn't even detect the ram to change RGB. It was stuck in rainbow mode.  I uninstalled it, and even after that aura wouldn't work at all. Had to completely reinstall OS.  Save yourself the headache and either get the non-pro version (which works fine with aura) or some tried and true trident z."
99,4.9,darrell,Good looking product,4,"September 18, 2021",the United States,The product really looks good but really don't notice any difference moving from 3000Mhz. Was able to set the static color and uninstall iCue which is very nice. Overall very happy with the purchase and since DIM prices are so low right now for such good memory take advantage and get something speedy that may be useful in the years to come.

I tried different timings, maybe if i ran it without the Lpx in the pc it would work but that would kind of defeat the purpose of adding memory. I am able to get it to run at 2933. My son also has corsair vengeance RGB pro ddr4 3200 only in his pc and also can not get it to run at 3200 either.

I used processor as AMD Ryzen 7 2700x with Asus Prime X470-pro motherboard and system always freeze up. At first I just think that it happens because of my BIOS is not updated. Then I updated my bios to last version, it works for two or three days. After that, last things start to happen again. So I have to change my RAM with Gskill Trident Z RGB version. If you want to use that ram with AMD processor, please check your motherboard's producer compatible device support, specifically  ""Qualified Vendor List"" which called as QVL.

Don’t cheap out on your pc parts. You will thank yourself later."
112,4.9,Nate and Alexis,"Good performance, though bulky",5,"September 9, 2021",the United States,"Overall, so happy I purchased! I got these for around $45 a stick (I usually shoot for under $60). I think my Ballistix Sport (non-RGB) ones are a bit better, but the RGBs on these look super cute. It's a nice way to spruce up your case and add interesting lights. At first, iCue wasn't detecting the sticks, but after repairing the program on my PC and restarting, it did work. I also have a Corsair bias - I just think their stuff is snazzy. *Be careful these will actually fit into your case/around your other parts. It barely fit in my mid-tower build.*"
113,4.9,Adrian,One of the Best RGB Ram on the market,5,"October 2, 2021",the United States,"Corsair Ram is usually more expensive because it's has a good looking design, Works with lots of motherboards and most importantly RGB. Mine work perfectly paired with my 3700x on a B550 Motherboard. It works great with the ICUE software but it can be a bit slow when first starting up. Colors are bright and if your sick of it you can either dim it or turn it off. Overall great but expensive."
114,4.9,John Needham,"Runs with no errors, LED lights look cool",5,"June 29, 2019",the United States,"Does its thing without problems, and looks cool doing it. My motherboard can't run this at nearly its full speed, but it still looks cool with the light. If it's too bright, turn the RGB numbers WAY down in the same ratio in the Corsair software to keep the same color but decrease the brightness. The stock brightness was like a light ceiling light bulb shining into my face, and lighting up my entire room very well. Hahaha."
115,4.9,Curious Shopper,"GREAT Value, but a slight learning curve for the lighting!",5,"July 23, 2019",the United States,"This is a GREAT set of RAM sticks. They are fast, functional, and well worth the price. My issue is with the RGB itself. There's a learning curve to use the software to get the desired effects. I like complicated light effects, so that's my own fault. If you want simple colors but have a lot of easily customizable light patterns within a few clicks these are great, and you can still achieve just about any pattern, or color you can think of. I personally like the G.Skill Trident RGB's better but these Corsairs are still functional and aesthetically pleasing."
116,4.9,Derrick Rebello,Rgb increases FPS,5,"May 13, 2020",the United States,We all know RGB increases performance in gaming by like 1000%. Well this ram is amazing. The software that is included with the ram is so customizable. The lights are so great and easy to customize.  You can set up different profiles for different settings to have custom light configurations activate.  Must have for any serious pc gamer
117,4.9,Ryan Miller,Works great.,5,"May 20, 2021",the United States,"Great ram, great light show. But I do use iCue to control all of my Corsair lighting stuff, as I have a good amount of it. Just make sure you are either running Liquid Cooled or a slim/high mount CPU cooler to clear the slots if you wanna use 4 (or any on a Micro ATX board lol) as they rise a bit high due to the RGB."
118,4.9,Austin Loeffelholz,"Great Purchase, but some setbacks",4,"January 27, 2020",the United States,Absolutely love this DDR4 Corsair RAM. The lighting looks perfect and it was a much needed upgrade from my DDR4 2400.

The iCUE software has a lot of customization options. It looks great and works great. My only complaint is that the RAM LEDs don't turn off when the computer goes to sleep. The RAM get's it's power directly from the MOBO, so there's no way for an aftermarket LED Controller to darken the RAM when asleep. This would be 5 stars if Corsair could fix this. I keep my PC in my room, so it's frustrating to have to shut the computer down when I want to sleep."

I'm pairing this with an AMD Ryzen 3950x, and unfortunately the G.Skill Trident Z (4x16) configuration ran into problems and didn't allow a full overclock. Also the RGB of the G.Skill would always go out of sync with eachother. The RGB on these Corsairs always stay in sync, and I like their effects. I would highly recommend these!"
127,4.9,Amazon Customer,"This ram is beautiful, and Runs Perfect at 3200mhz, Yes I have a ugly case and cable managment",5,"March 28, 2019",the United States,"I have an AsRock AB350 PRO4 Motherboard, Put the ram in, when I went to turn on my PC, The computer and Ram lit up, but then immediately shut down, Then it turned back on by itself, then it shut back down, Then it turned back on once more, and booted up Windows, It was probably just trying to get the correct timings since I had different ram installed before. Besides that, I didn't have to update my BIOS or anything fancy, Went straight into BIOS because it was running at Stock speed, 2134, Turned on XMP, and it runs PERFECT at 3200, NO ISSUES 100% Stable. and the RGB I kid you not, LOOKS so BEAUTIFUL in person, Photos can prove to you how gorgeous these sticks look, You have to see them in person, UP CLOSE and PERSONAL, The lights are so bright and beautiful, You will be loving them at first sight when they turn on. I really Love the rainbow stock affect, and don't plan on downloading the CUE software to change the colors, but thats my personal preference you know. You do you though. I recommend these to anyone looking for gorgeous RGB Ram."
128,4.9,Mony Nhong,"Light, power, and memory?",5,"November 20, 2021",the United States,"What a great memory, I meant RAM. Having LED light on my RAM make me feel like I can see the how hard my RAM is working even though it is intended for visual effect only. But, whatever make you happy is what matter. My computer is probably happy too, I think."
129,4.9,Scotty,Beautiful. Stable.,5,"May 11, 2021",the United States,Beautiful ram. The white sticks fit perfect in my build. And icue is by far the best rgb software I have used. Very impressive control of Corsair products and beyond.
130,4.9,Jared Boler,ARGB Software sucks,4,"July 31, 2020",the United States,"Sure, I can change it to any color I want. But to sync it up with Aura, you have to install the Corsair software first, and then download the Aura extension. That software constantly runs as a background process, even when you are controlling the RAM with Aura, In other words, there is a relatively heavy background process running at all times if you want to be able to customize it. I just leave it on the stock setting so that process doesn't run."
131,4.9,Joe Max,LED RGB lights burns out after few hours,1,"August 16, 2018",the United States,"bought two different sets of this new pro RGB, and both sets the RGB light on one of the sticks go out. tried the other set on a different setup and it did the same thing. returned. called corsair and they asked me to return them for a refund. which i did."
132,4.9,Steven & Heather,AMAZING RAM!!!!!,5,"February 26, 2019",the United States,The media could not be loaded.
133,4.9,Tyler,Do not use with aura sync,4,"April 12, 2021",the United States,"Overall, I am very happy with my purchase with one exception. When I try and sync up iCue and aura sync together the lights on the memory seem to freeze until I update it in the software every time I turn on my PC, while not affecting performance it is rather annoying considering I spent more to get the RGB opposed to the regular vengeance memory sticks. Overall, These are great sticks for your PC, they are easy to install and have truly amazing lighting options, if you plan on using aura sync and iCue together use a different brand of memory sticks unless you are ok with updating them every time."
134,4.9,King Kong!,Bad set of RAM,1,"February 16, 2020",the United States,"Computer crashed, got a new set of RAM because error code came out and said memory hardware issue. Switch out the memory and worked perfectly. I wanted a replacement, but instead I had to settle for a refund. Now the same memory cost a lot more than what I previously paid for. However, the Amazon agent tried to get me a replacement instead but was unsuccessful. Kudos! To her for trying."
135,4.9,Zac,Good RAM. Unlucky buyer. Good Customer Service (UPDATED),5,"September 7, 2020",the United States,UPDATE: The RAM kit with the faulty RAM was replaced with no hassle at all after sending a RMA ticket. Everything was paid for by Corsair. Even the shipping.
136,4.9,Franklin Moncion,product malfunction,1,"December 23, 2018",the United States,"this product was working perfectly for over 1 month suddenly it started to stop working my Pc started looping and had to remove one of them a put it back in tried a different motherboard and the issue continues , tried different ram cards on my motherboard and it works perfectly , so the issue is definitely the issue are your Ram card yo send me a damage issue and the worst part is that I'm located in dominican republic so its going to be more expensive for me to ship it all the way back to you So thats a Big L for me thanks Corsair !"
137,4.9,Aaron O'Brien,Perfecto!!!,5,"June 22, 2019",the United States,"At first I was using an off-brand RAM for my first PC build. I went out and got an RTX 2070 GPU, played a game of blackout and was getting super low FPS(around 40-65.) After performing a benchmark test, I saw my RAM was performing poorly and immediately knew that the cheap-o ram was the problem with my frame rate. I decided ordered these bad boys, and BOOM! instant differences in gameplay. I’m now experiencing 100-140 frames in blackout!  It to mention they have awesome RGB lighting."
138,4.9,Rtown,RMA for RAM 3 month old RAM 4x8gb 3200mhz,1,"January 10, 2021",the United States,They starting dieing in 3 months. 1 ram is dead and pc wouldn't post. Find and remove the guy ok pc works now yea... Random black screen/ freezing while gaming.
139,4.9,Adam,Oooh pretty!,5,"June 14, 2019",the United States,"Looks very cool in my case, wish I had known that the specific model I bought didn't work with Asus Aura sync (Product description was for multiple models, slightly misleading). Still, the lights are merely a small cosmetic thing and they look great! As ram it performs well, I don't really do anything super ram intensive so I don't have a good measure of just HOW good it is, but I usually run chrome on one monitor and a game on the other and everything works great."
140,4.9,Splintalol,"Yes BBY, you need the RGB",5,"December 13, 2019",the United States,"Corsair CUE works with the RGB and lets you change it to match your system. If you have a white build, are an RGB fiend, or already have Corsair CUE for your keyboard or fans or anything, just grab this. The RAM speed is as advertised and they've never given me any issues. Just make sure your mobo sets the ram speed correctly. I had to manually set it on my Gigabyte mobo. Just go ahead and toss me a ""helpful."" tyty"
141,4.9,M. L.,"Great product, but beware the height with air cooler use",5,"March 5, 2021",the United States,"These modules are 53mm high. That severely limits which heatsink/CPU air coolers will fit next to/over them, depending on how far outward the heatsink pipes spread before curving upward."
142,4.9,Roasty Toasty,Great size and performance,5,"May 7, 2021",the United States,Purchased the 2x8 (16g) 3600mhz to see if this was a good option and it was.
143,4.9,IonSound,"Pretty, but...",3,"February 27, 2021",the United States,"I ordered the 16gb kit for my new pc build, and as this was my first time building a pc, it took me a minute that my pc wouldn't start because one of my RAM sticks were faulty. So now I only have 8gb of RAM instead of the 16gb I payed for. It doesn't surprise me tho, it's pretty common that some parts are faulty coming out of the factory. But still can be disheartening for someone in my shoes who was stressed out over their first solo pc build."
144,4.9,Dr Zalost,"Very good memory, but could be better",4,"January 24, 2020",the United States,"This pair of RGB ram is very good. Very bright and some good rgb options. I feel like for the price you pay, there should be more effects with the rgb."
145,4.9,Bailey Kovak,Reviews about software are true,5,"November 9, 2020",the United States,Great for my new pc build. Love the rgb effect. The ice software though is bad just like reviews say. My bf installed for his to change the color and completely glitched out his computer. Once uninstalling software all was good. So I chose to not even mess with it and leave it rainbow rgb. But that's the only con I experienced.
146,4.9,Kevin B,iCue is okay,5,"October 28, 2020",the United States,"2 and a half years ago I hated iCue, now it's tolerable. I wish it was compatible with my Gigabyte motherboard as claimed to be, but oh well. The LEDs can get really bright, and XMP is working fine according to my BIOS. I mainly bought these because they're white and G.Skill Neos weren't in stock on my purchase date."
147,4.9,James,Buy it,5,"August 27, 2020",the United States,Beautiful RAM in an all-white system. Corsair's software makes customization a breeze.
148,4.9,Bakar Narimanidze,Works quite well,5,"January 4, 2022",the United States,"RAM Sticks (2x8GB) arrived on time and well packaged. Nothing extraordinary to use them, just plug&play style."
149,4.9,Al Carmona,Horrible service from Corsair,1,"August 10, 2021",the United States,"We purchased 2x8gb memory for my son's new tower build. Only 1 of the 2 memory sticks was working. AMZ customer service transferred me to Corsair support where the rep informed me that we had to return both. It's my son's virtual school computer and we need to have at least the 1 working ram stick in order for the computer to work. Corsair rep said that if we wanted to keep the 1 ram stick and return the other, then we'd have to go through a lengthy RMA process that involves leaving a deposit for the full amount of purchase. Crazy!! Horrible customer service from Corsair."
150,4.9,Charity West,"Super clean, but beware AMD users...",1,"February 17, 2020",the United States,"Got another set while Corsair RMA'd the first set due to not cold booting to advertised 3200mhz, the second set showed the same issue despite being on MSI's QVL page published for this specific mother board."
151,4.9,Nicholas H,Perfect Solution To My PC's Bottleneck,5,"May 5, 2021",the United States,"I recently bought a prebuilt gaming pc with some pretty darn good specs, unfortunately the one downfall was the amount of memory that came with the build wasn't enough for the games i was playing and bottlenecking my other components. I did some research on amazon and came to find the Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200MHz C16 LED Desktop Memory - Black was the perfect fix."
152,4.9,Josh Rogers,"A little overkill,maybe.",5,"May 18, 2021",the United States,"beautiful color and brightness.Great gaming performance,I do have docp set to an OC of 4200 running 4x8(32g). no ram issues ever,I play and use a lot of ram hungry games and programs and have no issues.Icue integration is great. i did have to change a few settings so it didn't bug out when Asus Armoury crate was controlling my case and mobo lights.Once I figured that out. it's  been smooth sailing."
153,4.9,Stephanie Rodriguez,rgb awesomeness,5,"September 26, 2020",the United States,"I am a loyal customer with Corsair for years now, you cant go wrong with them. I have never had any problems with anything that i have bought from Corsair. This memory works great. The rgb on it lights up bright and looks very nice sitting there glowing in rgb awesomeness, and the price is the deal maker cant beat it for 88 dollars. Trust me buy Corsair.  P.S. I dont work for them, I am just a fan. lol"
154,4.9,Andrew Johnson,Pretty light make computer go fast,5,"June 23, 2020",the United States,"I can't stop buying pretty lights that go inside my computer. These work through the MSI software to customize the lights to do whatever I want, and getting them up to 3200mhz was as easy as activating the XMP in the BIOS. Grabbed two more from microcenter (at the time these were $10 cheaper on amazon, but I couldn't wait), and now I'm set! Very happy with my colorful mess of a build."
155,4.9,Shaun G,Do not recomend,1,"November 10, 2020",the United States,Wtf is this? It doesn't even go 3600mhz...
156,4.9,justin,Looks great and works great ;),5,"October 17, 2021",the United States,works great when you first install the ram it’s at the completely wrong speed But once you go into the bios and enable XMP it fixes all the ram speed to spec after I did that the product is great works amazing
157,4.9,Samstrex,Overall pretty good,5,"March 17, 2021",the United States,"You get exactly what you pay for, it works as expected and the RGB is very bright. The design is somewhat boring after a while, but it is what it is. I would recommend the Corsair Vengeance rgb pro SF if you have an AIO up top because this ram is very very tall. All around, I would expect prices to be a little cheaper but the customizability in iCue is great."
158,4.9,Amazon Customer,Super product!,5,"November 14, 2021",the United States,"These are super great memory cards for PC! And they light up for those who want that. Great for all applications and gaming. Just make sure you get the right size, etc. that support your motherboard."
159,4.9,Folodia,Good RAM and very pretty,5,"November 1, 2021",the United States,"Packaging was very nice, RAM sticks both arrived fully functional. The RGB is also very nice and high quality. Overall a very nice RAM choice but I would recommend looking elsewhere if you are going for a budget build. Otherwise it's a very nice choice if you have the money."
160,4.9,Mikhail A.,Best RGB Memory Stick from Corsair,5,"February 1, 2019",the United States,The Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro probably has the best lightning for a memory stick. It can easily light up your whole pc with the ram sticks alone. I have 4 3200mhz sticks running at dual channel and xmp at 3.2ghz cl16 and it only runs at 43-47 degrees Celsius under load with the RGB lights on. It easily drops the temperature by 5 degrees when the lights are turned off. This is from an Nzxt H700 case with 3 Corsair LL120 fans as in take.
161,4.9,Javier Espada,Super Fast and Beautiful!!!,5,"July 12, 2020",the United States,"Beautiful and Fast!!! 16gb at a great price! All worked fine! Highly recommend it if you love some rgb in your life! I have all my LED lights from corsair, using icue is very easy and control everything from a single app, have profiles stored in the keyboard for easy change or to turn off when going to sleep."
162,4.9,Rowen Matthew Gunn,"Works great, easy to install and configure, bright!",5,"October 30, 2021",the United States,"Worked great, installed and set the XMP profile for 3200, and windows booted up perfectly with no issues. Verified the ram is running at 3200 and it’s worked perfectly since."
163,4.9,Charlotte Armstrong,Beautiful & effective memory sticks!,5,"October 21, 2020",the United States,I chose these for my new computer build. One of the two sticks was defective in my first pack so I requested a replacement. The new set arrived in 2 days and work perfectly. These are working wonderfully and look beautiful in the case at the same time. I am really glad I went corsair for my RAM! Great product & great service!

166,4.9,Danny Boy,Great as usual from Corsair!,5,"July 18, 2021",the United States,Easy to install. iCue software is easy to control colors and free. 32gb total shown here. Didn't think I needed that much RAM but when playing COD the system uses around 17gb. Looks cool and would recommend.
167,4.9,Winfield L. Marshall,I like Corsair,5,"June 19, 2021",the United States,I have never had an issue with Corsair ram. I use it in my more important builds. This is not the best ram for gaming but Corsair does make faster kits with lower latencies. If your into RGB this kit looks nice.
168,4.9,Marc Anderkin,Great Memory and Fast,5,"August 3, 2019",the United States,Super fast and great looking too. I love this memory because it makes my Pc look great while also working great. I have been pushing this memory and it has not missed a beat. I will definitely be buying another 16gb of this ram. I have been playing games like Rage 2 and Rebel Galaxy Outlaw on high with no issues. I know most of this is due to the Gpu but this memory really does scream.
169,4.9,Pierce K,RGB makes the world go round,4,"November 16, 2021",the United States,"Other than the STUPID iCue software that's required for the RGB to function in time with each other, and the fact that it's bloatware 99% of the time, this is great stuff."

171,4.9,ew,It is what it is.,4,"May 6, 2020",the United States,Good ram that you're over paying on for some RGB. If you don't care about looks or your budget is tighter don't get these. you can get better ram for the same price or the same level much cheaper.
172,4.9,Joharizan Khua,Does not work immediatly out of box,4,"May 29, 2020",the United States,"What did I mean by the headline? If you are a beginner in computers like me, you may have auto overclocking and auto XMP already activated in your AMD build, and if that's the case, my system didn't' even post. I thought i had dead ram on arrival but I tried deactivating the auto overclocking and auto XMP and it posted, only after it posting i went into the bios again and reactivated the settings and now everything is fine."

I sent it back to them and they lost it in their warehouse. Now they are saying they will not help me. So now I am out of my ram and wasted a lot of time during this process. I have bought corsair case fans, keyboards and ram but will never buy from them again. You cannot rely on corsair if you have any problems outside of the 30day amazon warranty. Horrible experience!"

183,4.9,Kevin,Looks great and runs as should,5,"January 9, 2021",the United States,Looks great! Son loves it. Just needed to go into msi bios to setup the 3200 MHz but it wasn’t difficult. It’s great

I wasn't able to play many games because I needed more memory for them to run smoother and I search for a few weeks and found these. The price is a little more than I was hoping to spend however I'm so happy with this purchase. I 100% recommend this for anyone that wants a little boost to there games! If your looking into streaming and gaming 32GB would be great I tested it on high settings and still have 10GB left over on high setting and runs so much smoother now.  It's the sweet spot! The best and cheapest upgrade I've made for a lot more performance! Also they look amazing in the PC!
188,4.9,Thomas Leggett,"looks great, works fine",5,"December 3, 2019",the United States,This product shipped in nice packaging and easy installation (it's RAM)
189,4.9,Jeremy W,Great RAM and the RGB feature is awesome!,5,"June 19, 2020",the United States,I'm a big fan of Corsair. The RAM was super easy to install. I already have iCue for my keyboard and headset. I was pleasantly surprised how quick iCue incorporated my color profiles with it. It's fun to mess with different settings/profiles if you have a clear PC case.
190,4.9,ST,DO NOT INSTALL ITS SOFTWARE,1,"September 9, 2020",the United States,"First of all, the iCUE software they tell you to install to control the RGB is useless. My computer wouldn't boot/turn on no matter what, and I remembered that the last thing I did was change the lights of my RAM. I took out one RAM and boom, the computer turned on. The first thing I did was uninstall that terrible, terrible software. I'm a little insulted that Corsair would even sell/promote this because people who aren't tech savvy would have to pay hundreds to go to a IT place to get their computer fixed."
191,4.9,MAShopper,Functional and beautiful!,5,"July 22, 2020",the United States,"Beautiful RGB effects and very functional memory as well. I have a mainly Corsair set up, using their Crystal white case, and LL120 Fans, so these RGB RAM fit right in nicely with the them in my case.

192,4.9,Paul Tetelboim,"Nice, cheap, and shiny",5,"July 13, 2020",the United States,I’ve never really had an issue with RAM being too slow before. These run plenty fast and have a low enough latency. They sync up with iCUE software and look really awesome in any mode. I use them as a visual temperature gauge for my GPU. Good bang for your buck chip.
193,4.9,Ivan A.,feliz con mi compra,5,"December 21, 2021",the United States,"borad H170-pro : sorprendido Al principio estaba asustado de que no funcionaran ya que mi board solo reconoce 2133mHZ pero resulta que las reconoce, estas bajan su frecuencia hasta las que soporta la board modifique un poco los voltajes y note que aumento un 0.2% de su capacidad . los chip de las ram son Samsung eso son buenas noticias son muy buenos"
194,4.9,Amazon Customer,Lookin good - FEELING GOOD.,5,"February 9, 2020",the United States,Okay I’ll admit it - I’m a sucker for RGB. These are rad and I never knew lighting could be like this. Easy installation of course - like most RAM. The lighting software is easy to use with infinite settings.
195,4.9,Michael Barnfield,Very cool,5,"May 2, 2021",the United States,I bought these because the ones I wanted were out of stock but boy was I pleasantly surprised. They turned out to be the centerpiece of my computer build. Lots of nice custom colors and patterns too. Just make sure you install the latest iCue software to get all the features.
196,4.9,The hulk,gave up on me after 3 months,1,"April 12, 2021",the United States,These no longer work in my pc after only 3 months of use. I had to buy new ones because something went wrong with it a week after amazon warranty. And corsair never go back to me to let me know about there warranty.

199,4.9,Amanda,Great product,5,"May 6, 2021",the United States,"I used this in my first pc build and it worked perfectly for over a year. Eventually I started to have random crashes and the RAM was the cause. I contacted Corsair and they replaced it with a brand new kit after I provided them with some details and proof of purchase. Although the original kit went bad, I would recommend this because of the excellent customer support."
200,4.9,Jeff,Advice please....,4,"January 26, 2019",the United States,"I have asus Rgb rog strix mother board z370. I have 4 sticks of corsair vengeance 8 gig 3200mhz. 2 sticks are rgb pro and 2 sticks are LED pro. Slot 1 is rgb pro, slot 2 is LED pro, slot 3 is rgb pro, slot 4 is LED pro. I can see and control all 4 sticks in the icue app.... My issue is, only slot 3 and 4 actually change lighting when I tell it to in the icue app. slot 1 and 2 are lit up just on random rgb wave and slot 2 is on random red led blinking. I can see them in the icue app along with slots 3 and 4 and all seems to be ok. When I try to change lighting effects only slot 3 and 4 respond. Do I need to change the placement of my ram sticks? should the rgb pro sticks be next to each other as well as the LED pro sticks? or do I have something else wrong?"

203,4.9,Orlen Powell,"Over priced, just paying for corsair name",5,"November 23, 2020",the United States,Great product but way over priced your paying almost double just for the rgb heatsink so unless you just want to be able to use corsair icue for the rgb its a waste of money just as good products if not better for cheaper
204,4.9,Cesar Monroy,"Not really into braindancing myself with RGB lights, but...",5,"December 22, 2020",the United States,"I really would like to have components that don't use RGB. Yet, it seems that most people spend time watching how their components pulsate, breathe, and so on, than using them for what they are designed: working, playing..."

207,4.9,Estuardo S.,"Buen rendimiento, muy lindo diseño",5,"June 16, 2019",the United States,"Me animé a comprar estas memorias porque me parecen de las más lindas que hay y combinan perfecto con el build white & black que buscaba. Al tocarlas notas el material premium, instalarlas es súper fácil y el RGB es sencillamente bello. Lo instale en una placa Aorus B450 pro wifi y hasta ahora no ha habido problemas de compatibilidad por más que no encontré este modelo en la lista QVL de dicha motherboard. Por default viene en 2133 mhz pero con sólo entrar en la BIOS con un par de clicks reconoce su velocidad real de 3200 mhz."
208,4.9,TEH MIGHTEH STEVE-O,Great RAM,5,"July 28, 2021",the United States,"Bought for my kiddos machine, he’s already in Corsair’s ecosystem. Works flawlessly on an MSI Tomahawk B550 with Ryzen 2600. RGBs work well and look good. Would recommend and would buy again."
209,4.9,Weston Dancewicz,Avoid at all costs,1,"January 10, 2019",the United States,Will not run 3200 speed on Intel Z390 board. Tried both XMP profiles and manually setting speed/voltage/timings. Board is supported on Corsair website but system will not post at this speed. One stick completely defective and causing blue screen crashes. Corsair would not warranty product. Save yourself some time and go with G Skillz.
210,4.9,Beldin,RBG Looking Sharp,5,"July 30, 2021",the United States,"First time using RGB ram, so many color options with the software. I can't even begin to explain the variety of color settings you can play with."
211,4.9,J. Washum,"Works great, ordering another pair!",5,"January 12, 2019",the United States,"Perhaps I got a newer BIOS, I haven't updated it yet, but I just finished my build with an Asus Strix x470 paired with an 2700x and had no issues running this memory at 3200 Mhz. It initially saw it as 3000 but a quick BIOS change and it was at 3200. Looks great, performs great as well. Only issue is now I want all my memory slots filled so I'm grabbing another set for 32GB."
212,4.9,B. Gill,Awesome RAM!,5,"November 10, 2019",the United States,"I bought 2x 16gb kits (4x8GB), great price for 32GB the RGB is controllable by the RGB Fusion 2.0 on my Aorus Pro and with Corsair's iQue software. RGB Fusion 2.0 is severely lacking compared to iQue. The animations are very nice and the RAM runs cool and fast, no need for additional cooling!"
213,4.9,Hseidel,Great,5,"February 20, 2021",the United States,"I ordered this for my son, and he built a whole gaming computer by himself. He loves this product!"
214,4.9,Aaron Cotton,One Module Defective,1,"December 9, 2020",the United States,I received this order undamaged through usps but one of the the 32gb modules would not post. Corsair was unwilling to replace it.
215,4.9,me,Fast RAM,5,"June 14, 2021",the United States,"Great RAM, super fast. Remember to go into your BIOS and change the RAM speed to 3600 because it defaults to 2133!"
216,4.9,Erick,my absolute favorite part of my build,5,"November 2, 2018",the United States,"i went with a full rgb build (ram, fans, cpu cooler & led strips) i am finding that when i play around with the corsair icue that i have multiple presets that im pretty much dimming every other led except for the led on these. they just look SO good. if i build another pc i would absolutely be ok with having no RGB anywhere except for on these ram sticks. they seriously are my favorite part of my build. i cant wait to add another 2 just for the cosmetic value"
217,4.9,Evan Katz,PRETTY SWAGGY,5,"April 28, 2021",the United States,"Love this RAM set, the white looks so good and the RGB is super bright, following in line with the rest of Corsair's RGB products, iCue is a little difficult to deal with if it's your first time. Just a little learning curve. At the end of the day I highly recommend these"
218,4.9,digitalexone,Looks great but you're paying for the RGB .,5,"January 2, 2020",the United States,Does the job and looks good while doing it. if you like RGB. these are nice and bright and as dim as you like them to be through IQ software which has gotten better but can use a little polishing . Looks great but you're paying for the RGB at this point. I will end up buying these again in a larger format
219,4.9,Preston Tauscher,This is an amazing looking RAM Kit,5,"February 18, 2019",the United States,"I received this ram kit about a month ago(8GBx2 3200MHz) and I have absolutely zero issues with them. First, they look absolutely amazing and the iCue software is very intuitive and has plenty of lighting options. I had no issue with them running out of the box, and the XMP profile worked perfectly once it was set to XMP in BIOS and haven't had any issues to speak of. I have not done any tightening of the timings past the XMP so I cannot speak to the ability of it to run tight timings but if you are just looking for a good looking RAM kit with fast out of the box frequencies you cannot go wrong with the Vengance Pro RGB."
220,4.9,Eddie money,Decent Ram,5,"December 5, 2020",the United States,I got 2 16gb packs and had to send a set back due to my PC no booting but got the other ones 2 days later. They work great and look good. Make sure to go into your bios and enable xmp profile so you get the most out of them.
221,4.9,Samuel H.,"Great Ram, Awful Software",3,"September 28, 2021",the United States,"Mine don't have any issues performance wise, But half the time I turn on my PC, ICue doesn't recognize one of the Dimms and that causes the lighting to go out of sync."
222,4.9,subzerolv,Great memory and fast,5,"November 4, 2021",the United States,I have 32gb of this in my PC build. It's low latency and takes easily to overclocking. The LED lighting is great too.

227,4.9,Wyatt Brinks,"Recieved a DOA part, 10 dollar refund was the best they could do.",1,"December 23, 2020",the United States,"Simple as it sounds. One of my sticks was faulty and causing a great deal of issues with my computer, I tried to get a return/refund on it to buy a new set of sticks and since I only figured out what part wasn't functioning outside of the return window, they only gave me a 10 dollar refund."

Recently overclocked from listed 3200mhz to 3400mhz using the xmp profiles and running great.  I have an ASrock B450m and ryzen 2600.  This kit isn't listed on Asrock QVL but no issues so far.  Cost was $130 when I purchased and was worth it.
231,4.9,Mike,Perfect product.,5,"December 2, 2020",the United States,I’m new to PC gaming and this was the first bit of hardware I ever installed myself. Took a few minutes and was as easy as can be. Immediately read by my computer and installed without a hitch.

234,4.9,N. Walters,Runs As Expected,5,"December 25, 2021",the United States,"Paired with an overclocked Ryzen 5700g and have had no issues. Good value for the speed/timing. RGB is diffused well. Corsair iCue software isn't great, but most RGB software isn't."

238,4.9,Takeshi,No Quality Control?,2,"September 8, 2020",the United States,DOA. Is there any quality control with these or did I just get unlucky?
239,4.9,Carlos Lopez,Could not read ram,3,"July 11, 2020",the United States,Could not get my pc to read both sticks after several installs. I thought maybe it was because i am running a ryzen processor 3700x but have read that others didnt have a problem. Ended up returning product. Was a good price just didnt work out for me
240,4.9,Gavin,Didn't have them for long,5,"December 8, 2020",the United States,"I only used these for a little bit, traded them for 32 gb of ram to my friend who wanted white ram. So I just got an upgrade, but for the sholrt time I had them. they were good."

242,4.9,David Kayvan,Solid Build,5,"February 9, 2021",the United States,"Man, this thing is solid. I love the lighting control and how fast this thing. Make sure in the bios you change the settings for your DDR4 set to 3200MHz otherwise it's not gonna recognize that you have a 3200MHz. Watch some youtube videos you'll understand. Very happy with Corsair products overall."
243,4.9,German L.,fitment!!,5,"March 1, 2021",the United States,great quality but does not fit with noctua nh-d15s on atx motherboard and corsair 570x case. better of going with the low profile none rgb.

245,4.9,Steven John Edward Frazer,Awesome!,5,"May 18, 2021",the United States,These were a fairly easy install. Getting them working correctly was different as it was my first actual build and hadnt messed with PC's in over a decade. So it was great!
246,4.9,James,Compatable with my motherboard,5,"April 3, 2020",the United States,Okay as Ive posted a question before an i cant find it again on here. Going to do a review since i now have the RAM an it is installed to my pc. I havea ASRock B450M-IBW Motherboard. NO INFO WHAT SO EVER FOR THIS MOBO ON THE INTERNET that i could find. So took it on myself bought 2 sticks of the 3200mhz ram an installed em today an they work are compatable an are amazing. So for those hunting for ram for same type mobo these rams are amazing. Now to do the gpu an such next month XD
247,4.9,Michelle,Works well!,5,"September 1, 2019",the United States,"The only issue I had with these was they really had to be shoved into my motherboard. Not sure if that's a normal thing as this was my first build, or maybe I was just being way too careful.  I like that they have RGB lighting as well. They look nice and work well!"
248,4.9,faisal a alruqi,AMAZON IS SO BAD AND THE PRODECT BAD ENOUGH,1,"December 11, 2021",the United States,AMAZON IS SO BAD AND THE PRODUCT BAD ENOUGH
249,4.9,Ron,It's a roll of the dice...,1,"September 1, 2019",the United States,Bought a kit of 3200 about a month ago and has worked flawlessly since initial install. Decided to buy a second kit and was met with extreme disappointment. Blue screens out the gate on initial boot after I stall. Sent for a replacement kit and was met with the same issue and had to downclock the kit to 2933 in order for it to remain stable. I am so incredibly disappoint and Aon the verge of returning this second kit due to it not working as intended.
250,4.9,TackJibe,Plug and play!,5,"May 13, 2021",the United States,Plug and play!  I was a bit nervous with the purchase but the cost was amazing compared to buying at Staples.
251,4.9,Robbie Williamson,Works with ryzen 5 3600 and b450 max mbo,5,"February 5, 2020",the United States,Love them. Used with on b450 tomahawk max board with ryzen 5 3600. Recognized the ram immediately. Aparantly there is overclocking potential aswell. The rgb is very bright and can be changed.
252,4.9,Jamie,This Ram is awesome.,5,"March 8, 2021",the United States,This ram is great. Looks awesome in my mid tower. Some people had complaints about dim rgb lights. This was not the case for me. They are bright and easy to control with the icue software. Would recommend for anyone looking for more rgb.
253,4.9,The Thompson’s,Great value!!,5,"December 27, 2020",the United States,"So nice!! Took a second to put them in but I've also never changed the ram sticks on a computer before. Once they're in though, I noticed a significant change in my computers performance! Definitely worth the money"
254,4.9,Sebastian,Great Product.,5,"October 12, 2020",the United States,Works as it should.. looks AMAZING. Easy to install.. and the software to control RGB is easy to use. Overall a great experience.
255,4.9,Lucas,Good,4,"October 20, 2019",the United States,Giving it a 4 only becuase one of my ram sticks glitched tf out and was stuck on red when i was switching through colors which freaked me tf out but not to worry i just put in rest mode the the next day after i turned on was fine but if that doesnt work update your icu rgb thing or whatever its called
256,4.9,TonyGZ,Went bad right at 90 days,1,"November 19, 2020",the United States,They look really cool. But this is the first time I've ever had a stick of ram go bad after 90 days. And of course I am no longer within the return period.
257,4.9,Customer,Love this so much works perfectly,5,"July 18, 2020",the United States,My ram went from 16gb to 32gb into my alienware aurora r6 works perfectly i would recommend buying this. Thanks Corsair for this now i can Edit videos and Play games Way better Super quick!
258,4.9,Rosemary,Defective Stick,2,"March 10, 2020",the United States,"One of my ram sticks had come defective and I couldn’t boot my new built pc for over an hour trying to figure out what was the problem, and why it kept failing. Once I finally took the ram stick out only then was I able to use my pc. The sticks are beautiful, but caused me to waste my time. Very dissatisfied in Corsair and I’m afraid to buy or recommend these sticks for my next builds or to my friends."
259,4.9,Bri Arredondo,Make sure to update mobo bios,5,"September 10, 2021",the United States,Everything about it was fine. Only issue i had was changing the speed in the bios. But i found out i had to update the bios and it worked just fine after that.
260,4.9,Dylan,Best looking ram. fastest ram you'll ever need.,4,"May 18, 2019",the United States,Everything about these ram sticks are amazing.
261,4.9,Prekay,Beautiful RGB Bliss!,5,"March 8, 2021",the United States,Absolutely stunning! I couldn’t be happier! I have the ROG Strix B550-F motherboard and the AMD Ryzen 5 3600 processor and this ram is compatible!
262,4.9,Amazon Customer,Get This ram....,5,"October 10, 2020",the United States,Solid as a rock works great with my ryzen  7-3700x. Smooth and absolutly great rgb look in the case. i Love it. Great satisfied customer.  Eventually i will get more of this ram. Its very nice to look at. no regrets.
263,4.9,RustyNail,Very slow rgb lights,3,"January 18, 2021",the United States,The LEDs on these take so long to change colors. Seems like a small thing until you try to change your LED colors and the ram takes seconds longer than all the other LEDs.
264,4.9,Eric Salvador,"In my opinion, the best looking RGB RAM as of the writing of this review",5,"August 16, 2018",the United States,"The RGB lighting on this RAM is beautiful and the iCUE software is easy to use. I'm running this on an ASrock x470 Fatal1ty and unfortunately I'm not able to get it to run at 3200MHz at 1.39 volts. The highest I'm able to run it at is 2933MHz @ 1.35. I'm not blaming the RAM for this, though. It's more than likely my motherboard which isn't the best overclocker according to reviews, and the RAM wasn't on the QVL. I still bought this RAM knowing this, so I'm not disappointed. Just be sure to check your motherboard's QVL if you want to run it at it's rated speeds."
265,4.9,Rocat14,Good ram for AMD 3600,5,"January 15, 2020",the United States,"The RAM looks great in the case. For the price this is about as good as you can get for RGB. Additionally it works very well with the Ryzen 3600x. No compatibility issues, just remember to bump up the base clock speed in the bios."
266,4.9,Ellie,Just get protection plan and you’ll be good,4,"November 25, 2019",the United States,Good memory especially since you can customize rgb with ICUE. Make sure you get protection plan though as I had to get a replacement twice as the first two sets kept blue screening my pc with different memory related error codes
267,4.9,Shadow Ranger,Recommend,5,"July 6, 2020",the United States,Got here fast..Was easy to install corsair packaged it nicely. And for me anyways I didnt need to fidget with the bios so that's a win in my book and the rgb lighting is awesome.
268,4.9,rolland browning,Just works,5,"October 11, 2021",the United States,AMD Ryzen 9 5000 series build on ASUS board X570 chipset works great.
269,4.9,Ronal Escobar,Una de las mejores memorias RAM RGB que puedan existir.,5,"October 2, 2021",the United States,"Excelente capacidad de oveclock, excelente refrigeración, excelente diseño (a mi gusto, mejores que las Trident Z) y el brillo es espectacular, basta que solamente la memoria Ram sea rgb para iluminar todo el gabinete. Lo único malo es que son grandes y si buscas un disipador grande por medio de aire el disipador tapa el rgb haciéndolas completamente inútiles..."
270,4.9,big mike,RGB white is a warmer than most Corsair RGBs,3,"September 3, 2021",the United States,"RGB white is a warmer than most Corsair RGBs.  I have the iCUE H150i, 7x iCUE QL120 fans, even my LIAN LI RGB STRIMER cables and LIAN LI O11 Dynamic XL RGB light match the same white color.  It's like comparing an incandescent bulb to a cool white LED bulb."
271,4.9,Yaniv,Looks so good,5,"July 18, 2019",the United States,Worked right out of the box with XPM on my 2700x and the lighting gives my atx case a nice aesthetic. Wish ram was a little cheaper but I guess thats what you get for leds.
272,4.9,R. Barfoot,The LEDs were a mess!,2,"November 26, 2020",the United States,"Unfortunately the individual LEDs in the modules I received all had different color tone, so they never matched. Enough to be very noticeable. It made the LED strip on each look blotchy. Really disappointing."
273,4.9,Kevin,Great RAM sticks.,5,"May 31, 2021",the United States,"Works great in my rig, with all my other components Corsair its easy to change the RGB through one app. Great product,"
274,4.9,McGriddleCakes,Good Memory,5,"November 28, 2018",the United States,"Corsair, of course it's good stuff. BE AWARE. Like one other person said the PRO version of this memory is NOT compatible with Asus Aura Sync.  The other link provided in the questions/answers is linking you to the information for the non pro version which IS compatible."
275,4.9,Randy,"Looks good, easy to install, but a little tall.",5,"April 13, 2019",the United States,Easy to install but a little tall. I have a Cooler Master 240mm liquid cooler installed and the fit for the RAM is a little snug. I might have to go with nonRGB RAM if I plan to add more.
276,4.9,Christopher Parks,Flashy RAM for a Flashy Build!,5,"March 10, 2019",the United States,"It works good, and the LED's look nice."
277,4.9,David H.,Nice!,5,"March 12, 2021",the United States,Easy to install. Reasonable price. Let's me play most of the games in the Xbox app for PC. I'm only using a Ryzen 3 3200G processor for now but I'm content with these RAM sticks... upgraded from just one 8GB RAM stick. Thinking I might purchase their 32GB RAM sticks too...
278,4.9,Matt Pooyanfar,did not work on ASUS B550m TUF,2,"January 18, 2021",the United States,My system would not boot with these chips on DOCP. solid yellow light on the MB and no boot. Had to go back to my old ram.
279,4.9,V. Fridman,It runs fine at 3600 MHz,5,"July 28, 2020",the United States,This kit runs perfectly fine at 3600 MHz on Asus ROG Zenith II Alpha motherboard. However it's more expensive then G.Skill 3600 MHz 256GB kits you can find elsewhere.
280,4.9,Ahmad,Two eight gigs of DDR4 3200 speed RAM,5,"July 16, 2020",the United States,The ram is great it! It lets me stream and lets me play games such as Modern Warfare and Apex legends incredibly well. It is also customizable with the iCue software which really helps me make it match my color theme. One thing to note is when I first bought the Ram I was getting 2100 mhz speed. But to fix this you just need to change your memory setting in your BIOS. It has caused me no problems what so ever and is a great buy!
281,4.9,EVB,Quick replacement - works as desired - thank you Amazon,5,"December 31, 2021",the United States,"Corsair packed product without RAM - Amazon replaced the it, with RAM. Can happen. Appreciate quick replacement. Thank you Amazon."
282,4.9,Tiffany,Great value,5,"April 18, 2021",the United States,Really happy and felt I got a good deal for the price as I did compare to other sites and stores.
283,4.9,Tyler,Super super fast!,5,"August 13, 2020",the United States,The LED’s are super awesome!! These were a great add on to all the other LED’s I have in my tower plus I’ve never had a faster computer in my life! 32gb of memory (4x 8gb sticks).
284,4.9,Michael Leahey,Always a good choice,5,"June 30, 2021",the United States,"Works great, looks great, what more could you want! These bench out very well."
285,4.9,Keith W. Lewis,High cost,4,"May 4, 2021",the United States,Was pretty but the price went way up so had to change brands for the sec pair saved me 60$
286,4.9,J Berbs,Very nice memory,4,"July 16, 2021",the United States,"Not only is this memory easy to set up in bios, it is so nice with the rgb lights. So far no problems."

289,4.9,Mateo,Excelente RGB - pero no funciona el XMP,5,"November 25, 2020",the United States,"La luminosidad del RGB es la mejor del sector, si te interesa el RGB esta es tu memoria RAM ni lo dudes."
290,4.9,Cas,Love It!,5,"December 30, 2021",the United States,I put these in my pc a few days ago and they work great! Way better than my one stick of 8gb. The lighting on these are sick too especially the different rgb settings with the Corsair software you can download. Next up is Corsair fans to go with em!
291,4.9,Alfonso Aguila,Cant run 3200hz with 32gb could only hit 3200hz with 16gb,1,"May 29, 2020",the United States,I purchased 16gb and ran 3200hz no problem but I wanted to get another 16gb to complete the 32gb but now I could only go up to 2666hz if I go up 3200hz my computer crashes and gives me the blue screen of death so I will have to tweak it down. I already tried bumping the voltage and no help running a ryzen 2700x msi x470 carbon pro. Could it be possible that I got defective ddr4?
292,4.9,Bryan Downs,Beautiful.,5,"April 17, 2021",the United States,In sure there are better ones for gaming. But price for what you get... very nice. Beautiful LEDs and tons of options with them. 3200mhz as it said.

294,4.9,Joel,Fast basher.,5,"October 14, 2021",the United States,So far it's been great. Very sturdy and durable Rc truck
295,4.9,Jee Kong,It works and love the RGB!,5,"May 26, 2021",the United States,Bought this a few months ago. Needed rams for my 1st ever PC build so I came across these. It works.
296,4.9,Logan,Incredible looking RGB RAM running at rated speed,5,"December 23, 2018",the United States,Got a pair of these to go with my Ryzen 2700x hoping they would be b-die but they weren’t. I got a pair of Hynix CJR.
297,4.9,Víctor Vásquez,Beautiful!,5,"September 11, 2021",the United States,I bought these modules last year and have been performing excellent.
298,4.9,Kaylee,good overall,4,"May 27, 2021",the United States,"got these for my bf on his new build, very cute aesthetically and do what they need to do."

301,4.9,John Sheesley,Will not hit 3200mhz on Ryzen 2700x,1,"April 7, 2020",the United States,Won't do it. System won't post with clocks over 2800. Using 4 sticks on a Strix x470F Gaming and it won't work. Will hit 3200 with 2 sticks but not with 4. RAM must be faulty.
302,4.9,R. Patel,WHAT IS GAMER RAM?,5,"December 12, 2019",the United States,Good RAM no problems. I don’t what or why I was asked to rate this for gaming. RAM is RAM. You will not notice a microsecond or a millisecond or a nanosecond.  Just get the modern standard and you’ll be fine.
303,4.9,Brandon,Great looking RGB ram for a competitive price.,5,"March 13, 2019",the United States,"This 3200 mHz ddr4 ram is a bargain compared to the other RGB ram sticks on amazon, such as the g.skill trident z rgb sticks. The corsair vengeace RGB PRO offers more leds and significantly larger housing compared to the g.skill trident z rgb. Also, It's cheaper, and on amazon you can get a 3200 mhz 16 gb kit of corsair vengeance rgb ram for around $20 less than a 3000 mhz kit of g.skill trident z rgb."
304,4.9,Henry Ma,Better pricing,5,"July 12, 2021",the United States,"Easy to install, really nice, and I would recommend this because the price is similar to non rgb"

306,4.9,Alyssa Gleason,Looks great in PC,5,"October 3, 2020",the United States,Super easy to install ! Looks great in the PC and works great. Never had any problems and we use the app to change colors of the sticks
307,4.9,AWCAWCAWC,Icue and RGB settings are annoying,3,"March 28, 2021",the United States,Icue is super bloated and annoying. It's buggy and doesn't always turn the RGB off upon sleep.
308,4.9,Michael S,Read Carefully.,1,"June 8, 2020",the United States,I I bought this thinking it was one 16 GB stick of ram not realizing it was two 8GB. My PC can only hold two sticks and I already have one in there So this was a waste of money for me so I guess if anyone wants one for free they can have my extra one. Unless there is another way to add the extra one without getting another motherboard?
309,4.9,Elad Dai,ASUS AURA BUILDERS BEWARE!,4,"February 16, 2020",the United States,"This is an excellent RAM, got this on sale and im super happy with it."

312,4.9,RJ,Great performance and styling,5,"December 4, 2021",the United States,It perfectly fits my desktop and is very easy to install. The performance is quite more than what I expected. I am really enjoying my gaming experience now with this RAM installed in my Gaming PC.

315,4.9,mom10,BEWARE!!,1,"August 3, 2019",the United States,Do not order from here!  We received a piece of wood!  Someone is making some money on the side.  I tried  to upload a picture but it does not work.  Luckily Amazon gave us a refund.  Once again!  Do not order unless you want a $100 piece of wood.
316,4.9,Amazon Customer,Works great!,5,"October 24, 2021",the United States,Works great. I would buy more in the future
317,4.9,Moso,Great Performance and Style,5,"June 13, 2019",the United States,"There is not a lot to say here. They work great and the look great if you are into RGB. I highly recommend, the lighting is crisp and clear and doesn't have the hazy glow you see from other brands, looking at you G.Skill. Really sharp clear colors. Great buy!"
318,4.9,Armand Gerstenberger,Do not install Corsairs ICUE software,2,"October 21, 2020",the United States,BSOD after BSOD until ICUE was uninstalled. Corsair's K95 keyboard then died and now I'm getting crashes because of issues with RAM. Avoid Corsair products
319,4.9,Amazon Customer,Looks great,5,"June 5, 2021",the United States,The media could not be loaded.
320,4.9,Trellistar,Gorgeous,5,"September 10, 2020",the United States,"These are worth the extra money over their non RGB memory. Unlike a lot of Corsair RGB products, these are worth the extra cost."
321,4.9,Lee,3600? Not quite,4,"July 9, 2021",the United States,Could not get these to clock over 3400 and be stable.
322,4.9,Alina Astor,Faulty set,1,"July 17, 2020",the United States,Got a faulty set. Tell me the chances..
323,4.9,Roza,Great Ram,4,"April 22, 2021",the United States,"This ram is amazing, but I gave it 4 stars because this is not for the enthusiast. What I mean by that is that you cannot overclock this ram and other things. Great ram but if you are an enthusiast I would go for some crucial ballistix ram."
324,4.9,Aguy,No issues with Ryzen,5,"October 23, 2018",the United States,A small change in the BIOS settings allowed them to operate at the rated 3000MHz. They look fantastic and are very bright. Price wise they seem to on par with other brands but look way better in my opinion. The color options are plentiful and easy to control with the iCUE software.
325,4.9,James,Performs as advertised,5,"October 7, 2021",the United States,"Not much to be said, it's ram. It's pretty, the software corsair provides allows you to change the rgb setting easily, and you don't have to change them in-between each startup, the settings are re-enabled after you boot into windows. Other than that, the product performs as advertised."
326,4.9,Robert C.,Cool Memory,5,"May 23, 2020",the United States,Looks good. Runs fast. Memory to spare.
327,4.9,Karlos Kistaman,"Super easy to install, and works flawless.",5,"December 8, 2020",the United States,"One of the easiest things I've done is install this ram, and I'm by know means any sort of computer expert or guru."
328,4.9,Brinda Cantu,Love!,5,"December 4, 2021",the United States,"These are so amazing, I love them so much! They're quite expensive, but worth the money."
329,4.9,WesN,Good quality but ...,5,"August 7, 2020",the United States,The ram is fine but 3600mhz does not work of the Gigabyte x570-pro wifi mobo fastest I can get with 32gb dimms is 3266.
330,4.9,Jennifer Elizalde,Works great,5,"August 12, 2021",the United States,It was easy to install for my first P.C.

They have a really neon color and look wonderful, A picture wouldn't do them any justice. I will buy 2 more for a total of 32GB and 4x8gb sticks. It works well with my Ryzen system."
332,4.9,Don Juan,"Fancy, budget ram",5,"October 31, 2020",the United States,Easy to install and durable. Ubuntu is running less ram process than the macbook pro that has the same gb of ram. Value for the money is budget friendly.

335,4.9,Tim Reeves,Perfect for Gaming Build,5,"March 5, 2021",the United States,"Works perfectly. The RGB lighting is nice, but still looking to see if I can sync with fan,etc. lighting so they aren't independently doing their own thing. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for and I've never had a problem with Vengeance Corsair RAM."
336,4.9,Jacob c.,lovely colors and it matches my system perfectly,4,"October 16, 2020",the United States,look great the only problem is my motherboard wont got up past 3000mrhz so its basiclly stuck there which is fine
337,4.9,Seth,Uneven lighting and unstable RAM,1,"June 6, 2019",the United States,"The lighting is uneven, on any solid color you can really see where the LEDs are in the diffuses. On white, its more of a pastel rainbow. Additionally, on my Ryzen 2600x with a B450 ASUS Gaming Strix board, I could not get this to run at the advertised speed, I would simply crash or have problems running programs and games."
338,4.9,Fredrick Samuels,Nice,5,"November 16, 2021",the United States,Just as advertised easy to install
339,4.9,Aodhan,Works Great,5,"November 16, 2020",the United States,Perfect for upgrading your ram. Works perfectly out of the box. The Icue software works great for controlling the lighting. Lights are very bright.

341,4.9,Amazonerd,Great but would only get on sale,5,"December 27, 2019",the United States,Got this on sale over the holidays else I wouldn't recommend. Great speed and quantity for that price. RGB isn't necessary but works as expected. No issues out of the box.

351,4.9,Devin,"Good RAM, Good Gracious",5,"December 13, 2019",the United States,"I've always used Corsair or Ripjaw RAM. I tried to tell myself that this build would be heavy on cable management and a sleek design without gimmicks. That being said, I saw these RAM sticks and couldn't stop myself."
352,4.9,Gary Rohr,Works great in my ASRock 570 Taichi motherboard,5,"August 12, 2020",the United States,MB can go up to 128 GB but the 64 GB I have is performing great. I don't game so can't say how well it works for that

366,4.9,Will Otzenberger,Great beautiful RAM!,5,"January 7, 2020",the United States,Ram is great! No Need to buy anything faster because you can truly utilize the speeds in most applications. Just make sure when you install it that you go back into your computer BIOS and set the speeds properly. Makes a massive difference!
367,4.9,Katie,Awesome!,5,"December 19, 2020",the United States,"Not much to say other than I love them! They look super nice, were easy to install and the ICUE software works great with them.

Well worth the money."

Llegó fácilmente a la velocidad anunciada con la configuración xmp 2.0 desde la BIOS. La función rgb funciona bien aunque el software es muy básico.
396,4.9,Omar,"Works well, looks even better",5,"November 20, 2019",the United States,"Solid RAM - had instability issues when running with the XMP profile, but that was likely an issue with my motherboard - not well versed in overcloking, but I set it manually and it's running smoothly at 3200MHz C15. RGB looks fantastic, iCUE software is easy to use. I've heard different reports, but I can say that the 3200MHz kit I ordered was Samsung B-Die, so take that as you will. Good RAM, good price for the RGB + B-Die imo."
397,4.9,Brenage,Style over Substance,5,"July 2, 2021",the United States,"Let’s be real, at this price point, you’re paying for the RGB customization and white accents. And let me just say, it’s entirely worth it."

403,4.9,Keith Y.,Very Nice Corsair Vengeance DDR4 Ram!,5,"February 23, 2019",the United States,Very high quality and the rgb lighting is amazing.

It takes a bit for the lighting settings to load in and actually show on the ram sticks.
404,4.9,Josh,Great Product!,5,"April 19, 2021",the United States,"This set came very very quickly. I love the way the RGB looks very very nice, and with the iCue software you can do tons of cool customization with the RAM lights.

476,4.9,Chase,"Love the looks, performance, and RGB",5,"March 10, 2021",the United States,I bought this RAM to upgrade from DDR3.
